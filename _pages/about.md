# About me

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at [Augmented Health Lab](https://www.ah-lab.cs.dartmouth.edu/){:target="\_blank"} at Dartmouth College, working with [Prof. Temiloluwa Prioleau](https://faculty-directory.dartmouth.edu/temiloluwa-o-prioleau). I did my M.S. at Duke University - Biomedical Engineering, used to work with [Prof. Jessilyn Dunn](https://bme.duke.edu/people/jessilyn-dunn/) at [Big Ideas Lab](https://dunn.pratt.duke.edu/).

My research interest is in the field of **Applied AI/ML**, **Ubiquitous and mobile sensing** and **Digital Health**, specifically leveraging sensor data from wearable devices to assist health monitoring and management using AI/ML approaches.

I have extensive research and engineering experience in multimodal wearable sensing, time-series modeling, and large-scale ML system development. My work spans building end-to-end mobile health platforms (Android/iOS clients, cloud backends on GCP, Firebase-based data infrastructure) to designing benchmarking studies for time-series foundation models and LLM-based architectures for blood glucose forecasting. I have developed scalable pipelines for processing high-frequency physiological signals (e.g., CGM, PPG), trained deep learning models including CNNs, LSTMs, Transformers, and foundation models, and conducted rigorous evaluation on real-world clinical and consumer-grade datasets. Through internships at Samsung Research and Novo Nordisk, I further translated research into large-scale production-oriented ML pipelines and multimodal health AI systems.
