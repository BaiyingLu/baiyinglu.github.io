# About me

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at [Augmented Health Lab](https://www.ah-lab.cs.dartmouth.edu/){:target="\_blank"} at Dartmouth College, working with [Prof. Temiloluwa Prioleau](https://faculty-directory.dartmouth.edu/temiloluwa-o-prioleau). I did my M.S. at Duke University - Biomedical Engineering, used to work with [Prof. Jessilyn Dunn](https://bme.duke.edu/people/jessilyn-dunn/) at [Big Ideas Lab](https://dunn.pratt.duke.edu/).

My research interest is in the field of **Ubiquitous and Wearable Computing** and **Digital Health**, specifically leveraging digital phenotypes from wearable devices to assist diabetes monitoring and management.

I led a project that leveraged users' insulin pump meal log data and constructed personalized machine-learning models, enabling precise predictions for carbohydrate intake timing, which can facilitate better in-time insulin delivery. In addition, I designed and developed front- and back-end components of a health monitoring mobile application to integrate
continuous data from medical- and customer-grade wearable devices to inform personalized management of diabetes.
Currently, my research involves using contextual data from individuals' daily lives, including heart rate, step count, and physical exercise metrics, to provide real-time predictions for glucose range and variation.
